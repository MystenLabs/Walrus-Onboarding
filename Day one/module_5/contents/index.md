# Storage Costs Developer Curriculum

Welcome to the Storage Costs Developer Curriculum! This curriculum is designed to help developers understand how storage costs work in Walrus, estimate costs for their use cases, and optimize their storage spending.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this curriculum, you will be able to:

1. **Estimate storage cost** - Calculate the approximate cost of storing data on Walrus for different scenarios
2. **Understand cost drivers** - Identify the factors that influence storage costs and how they interact

## Curriculum Structure

This curriculum is organized into the following sections:

1. **[Cost Model](./cost-model.md)** - Understanding the fundamental cost structure
   - The four sources of cost
   - How costs are calculated
   - Encoded size vs unencoded size
   - Cost components breakdown

2. **[Short Storage versus Extended Storage](./storage-duration.md)** - Understanding how storage duration affects costs
   - Short-term storage strategies
   - Long-term storage considerations
   - Cost implications of different durations
   - When to use each approach

3. **[Budget Planning in Real Projects](./budget-planning.md)** - Practical guidance for project planning
   - Estimating costs for your use case
   - Budget allocation strategies
   - Monitoring and tracking costs
   - Cost forecasting

4. **[Cost Reduction Ideas](./cost-reduction.md)** - Strategies to minimize storage costs
   - Reusing storage resources
   - Batch operations
   - Optimizing blob sizes
   - Resource management strategies

5. **[Scenarios Based on Common Product Needs](./scenarios.md)** - Real-world examples
   - Small file storage (documents, images)
   - Large file storage (videos, datasets)
   - Temporary data storage
   - Permanent archive storage
   - High-volume use cases

6. **[Hands-On Exercises](./hands-on.md)** - Practical cost calculation exercises
   - Calculate costs for given scenarios
   - Use CLI tools to estimate costs
   - Compare different storage strategies

## Prerequisites

Before starting this curriculum, you should have:

- Basic understanding of the Walrus CLI
- Familiarity with WAL and SUI tokens
- Basic command-line interface experience

## Next Steps

Start with [Cost Model](./cost-model.md) to understand the fundamental cost structure, then proceed through the duration, planning, and optimization sections to learn how to estimate and minimize costs for your specific use cases.
