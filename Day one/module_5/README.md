# Module 5: Storage Costs and Budget Estimation

This module provides comprehensive training on understanding, estimating, and optimizing storage costs in Walrus. Learn how to calculate costs for different storage scenarios, plan budgets for real projects, and implement cost reduction strategies.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Estimate storage cost** - Calculate the approximate cost of storing data on Walrus for different scenarios
2. **Understand cost drivers** - Identify the factors that influence storage costs and how they interact
3. **Plan budgets** - Create accurate budget plans for real-world projects
4. **Optimize costs** - Apply cost reduction strategies to minimize storage spending
5. **Analyze scenarios** - Evaluate different use cases and recommend appropriate storage strategies

## Module Structure

This module is organized into the following sections:

### 1. [Cost Model](./contents/cost-model.md)

Understanding the fundamental cost structure

- The four sources of cost (Storage Resources, Upload Costs, Transaction Costs, Object Costs)
- How costs are calculated
- Encoded size vs unencoded size
- Cost components breakdown
- Storage units calculation

### 2. [Short Storage versus Extended Storage](./contents/storage-duration.md)

Understanding how storage duration affects costs

- Short-term storage strategies
- Long-term storage considerations
- Cost implications of different durations
- Storage resource reuse
- When to use each approach

### 3. [Budget Planning in Real Projects](./contents/budget-planning.md)

Practical guidance for project planning

- Estimating costs for your use case
- Budget allocation strategies
- Monitoring and tracking costs
- Cost forecasting
- Real-world budget planning examples

### 4. [Cost Reduction Ideas](./contents/cost-reduction.md)

Strategies to minimize storage costs

- Reusing storage resources
- Batch operations and grouping small blobs
- Optimizing blob sizes
- Resource management strategies
- Transaction cost optimization
- Object cost management

### 5. [Scenarios Based on Common Product Needs](./contents/scenarios.md)

Real-world examples based on common product needs

- Small file storage (documents, images)
- Large file storage (videos, datasets)
- Temporary data storage
- Permanent archive storage
- High-volume use cases

### 6. [Hands-On Exercises](./contents/hands-on.md)

Practical cost calculation exercises

- Calculate costs for given scenarios
- Use CLI tools to estimate costs
- Compare different storage strategies
- Create budget plans for real projects
- Monitor and track costs

### 7. [Instructor Guide](./contents/instructor-guide.md)

Comprehensive teaching guide for instructors

- Section-by-section guidance
- Teaching tips and discussion points
- Assessment suggestions
- Common issues and troubleshooting
- Module completion checklist

## Module Completion

After completing this module, you should be able to:

- Calculate storage costs for any blob size and duration
- Understand encoded size and how it affects costs
- Create accurate budget plans for projects
- Identify and apply appropriate cost reduction strategies
- Analyze real-world scenarios and recommend storage approaches
- Monitor and track actual costs vs estimates
