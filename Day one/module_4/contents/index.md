# Epochs and Storage Continuity Curriculum

Welcome to the Epochs and Storage Continuity Curriculum! This curriculum covers how Walrus manages
time through epochs and how to maintain data availability over time.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this curriculum, you will be able to:

1. **Understand how epochs affect storage** - Know how the system lifecycle impacts data retention.
1. **Understand continuity and extension rules** - Learn how to keep data safe across epoch
   transitions.

## Curriculum Structure

This curriculum is organized into the following sections:

1. **[Epochs, Continuity, and Extension](./01-epochs-continuity.md)** - Core concepts
   - Epoch lifecycle
   - Storage continuity mechanisms
   - Storage extension rules
   - Real-world scenarios

1. **[Hands-On Exercises](./02-hands-on.md)** - Practical application
   - Interpret epoch timelines
   - Solve continuity puzzles

## Next Steps

Start with [Epochs, Continuity, and Extension](./01-epochs-continuity.md) to master the concepts, then
test your understanding with the [Hands-On Exercises](./02-hands-on.md).
