# Module 14: Use Cases and Design Patterns

Welcome to Module 14, the capstone module of the Walrus Training Program! This module brings together everything you've learned to solve real-world storage challenges.

> **Capstone Module**: This is where theory meets practice. You'll analyze real use cases, understand design patterns, and create complete storage plans.

## 📚 Overview

This module teaches you how to:

- Map Walrus capabilities to real-world problems
- Design storage solutions for NFT metadata
- Build decentralized websites with Walrus Sites
- Handle multi-part datasets efficiently
- Apply patterns from production systems
- Make practical design choices
- Create complete storage plans

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will be able to:

1. **Map Walrus capabilities to real solutions** - Identify which Walrus features solve specific storage challenges and design appropriate architectures

## 📖 Curriculum Structure

The module is organized into practical case studies:

### Real-World Use Cases

1. **[NFT Metadata Storage](./contents/01-nft-metadata.md)** - Permanent, verifiable metadata
   - Why NFT metadata needs decentralized storage
   - Storage cost analysis
   - Metadata structure and quilts
   - Best practices for NFT projects

2. **[Walrus Sites](./contents/02-walrus-sites.md)** - Decentralized websites
   - How Walrus Sites work
   - Deployment patterns
   - Cost optimization
   - Production examples

3. **[Multi-Part Datasets](./contents/03-multi-part-datasets.md)** - Large, structured data
   - Chunking strategies
   - Parallel upload/download
   - Index management
   - Recovery patterns

4. **[Proof of Concept Patterns](./contents/04-proof-of-concepts.md)** - Lessons from production
   - Social media content
   - Gaming assets
   - Scientific data
   - Common patterns and anti-patterns

5. **[Design Choices](./contents/05-design-choices.md)** - Practical decision-making
   - Blob vs quilt decision framework
   - Epoch planning
   - Publisher vs direct storage
   - Cost vs performance trade-offs

### Capstone Project

6. **[Hands-On Lab](./contents/06-hands-on-lab.md)** - Complete storage plan
   - Choose a use case
   - Analyze requirements
   - Design architecture
   - Calculate costs
   - Create implementation plan
   - Present solution

## 🚀 Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have completed:

- ✅ Module 1-2 (Introduction and Architecture)
- ✅ Module 5 (Storage Costs)
- ✅ Module 6 (CLI) or Module 7 (SDK)
- ✅ Module 8 (Publishers and Aggregators) - recommended
- ✅ Understanding of epochs, erasure coding, and quilts

## 💻 Hands-On Capstone

The final lab is a **capstone project** where you:

1. **Select** a real-world use case
2. **Analyze** storage requirements
3. **Design** a complete Walrus solution
4. **Calculate** costs and performance
5. **Document** the architecture
6. **Present** to the class

This demonstrates your mastery of Walrus storage design.

## 🎓 Module Approach

**This is a synthesis module**:
- References concepts from all previous modules
- Emphasizes practical application
- Includes real production patterns
- Culminates in capstone project

**Format**:
- Case study analysis
- Group discussions
- Design exercises
- Peer review
- Final presentations

## 📊 Assessment

Your capstone project will demonstrate:
- Understanding of Walrus capabilities
- Ability to map features to requirements
- Cost-effective design choices
- Practical implementation planning
- Clear technical communication
