# Use Cases and Design Patterns

Welcome to the **capstone module** of the Walrus Training Program! This module synthesizes everything you've learned and applies it to real-world storage challenges.

## Learning Objective

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

**Map Walrus capabilities to real solutions** - Analyze storage requirements, select appropriate Walrus features, design cost-effective architectures, and create complete implementation plans.

## Why This Module Matters

Previous modules taught you **what** Walrus does and **how** it works. This module teaches you **when** and **why** to use specific features to solve real problems.

You'll learn from:
- Production use cases
- Design patterns that work
- Common mistakes to avoid
- Cost optimization strategies
- Real implementation experiences

## Module Structure

### Part 1: Case Studies (Lessons 1-4)

Analyze real-world applications:

1. **[NFT Metadata Storage](./01-nft-metadata.md)** - 25 min
   - Permanent metadata requirements
   - Cost analysis for NFT projects
   - Quilt usage for collections
   - Best practices

2. **[Walrus Sites](./02-walrus-sites.md)** - 25 min
   - Decentralized website hosting
   - Site builder workflow
   - Deployment patterns
   - Production examples

3. **[Multi-Part Datasets](./03-multi-part-datasets.md)** - 25 min
   - Large file strategies
   - Parallel operations
   - Index management
   - Use cases: ML models, scientific data, media libraries

4. **[Proof of Concept Patterns](./04-proof-of-concepts.md)** - 25 min
   - Patterns from production systems
   - Social media content storage
   - Gaming asset management
   - What works and what doesn't

### Part 2: Design Framework (Lesson 5)

5. **[Design Choices](./05-design-choices.md)** - 30 min
   - Decision frameworks
   - Blob vs quilt selection
   - Epoch planning
   - Publisher vs direct storage
   - Cost vs performance trade-offs
   - Architecture patterns

### Part 3: Capstone Project (Lesson 6)

6. **[Hands-On Lab](./06-hands-on-lab.md)** - 90-120 min
   - Choose a use case
   - Analyze requirements
   - Design complete solution
   - Calculate costs
   - Create implementation plan
   - Present to class

## Prerequisites

This module assumes you understand:
- Walrus architecture (blobs, slivers, storage nodes)
- Epochs and storage continuity
- Cost model (storage units, epochs)
- Quilts and when to use them
- Upload and download workflows
- Publishers and aggregators (optional infrastructure)

If you need to review, revisit:
- Module 2 (Architecture)
- Module 5 (Storage Costs)
- Module 7 (Quilts)

## Key Concepts Reinforced

This module reinforces understanding of:

**Storage Features**:
- Blob vs quilt selection
- Epoch planning for continuity
- Deletable vs permanent storage
- Resource reuse

**Cost Optimization**:
- Quilt savings for small files
- Epoch extension strategies
- Encoded size calculations
- Storage unit pricing

**Operational Patterns**:
- Publisher deployment
- Aggregator usage
- Direct client integration
- Error handling

**Design Principles**:
- Decentralization benefits
- Verifiability
- Byzantine fault tolerance
- Cost-effectiveness

## Learning Approach

This module uses:

**Case Study Analysis**:
- Real requirements
- Design constraints
- Solution architectures
- Lessons learned

**Group Discussions**:
- Compare approaches
- Debate trade-offs
- Share insights
- Learn from peers

**Design Exercises**:
- Apply frameworks
- Calculate costs
- Evaluate options
- Document decisions

**Capstone Project**:
- End-to-end design
- Peer review
- Presentation
- Feedback

## Success Criteria

You'll successfully complete this module when you can:

- ✅ Analyze storage requirements for a use case
- ✅ Select appropriate Walrus features
- ✅ Calculate storage costs accurately
- ✅ Design scalable architectures
- ✅ Justify design decisions
- ✅ Create implementation plans
- ✅ Communicate technical designs clearly

## Next Steps

Start with **[NFT Metadata Storage](./01-nft-metadata.md)** to see how Walrus solves permanent storage for NFTs, then progress through the other case studies before tackling the capstone project.

**This is where everything comes together!**
